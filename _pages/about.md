I am **Damiano Giusti**, passionate **Android developer**, rock **music lover** and **guitar player**.

Welcome to my blog, a place where I share some pills from my every day experience about mobile apps 
development and software engineering. 

I started developing for the Android platform back in 2013, and I published my first app in 
the same year. It was a mobile version for an italian well-known electronic grade book. Since I was
at school in such period, I was using my grade book on a daily basis for checking assignments, 
schedules and, obviously, grades. At that time there wasn't an official application for receiving
notifications and allowing students to easy consult their school report... Until my app was born!

I'm currently working as Software Engineer at MOLO17, an italian company which moves really fast. 
I'm mainly focused on the Android development. I love exploring new technologies and applying new
architectures to my projects. 

I'm proudly advocating for the adoption of the **Kotlin** language. I built the latest projects of
my company using it with profit. Also, I'm experimenting the **Kotlin Multiplatform** feature, 
discovering the great amount of possibilities that such technology makes available to us. 

I also held some talks, proudly participating at the first edition of the Milan KotlinCommunityConf,
the first italian conference dedicated to Kotlin.  
Here's the list for you, with some references where available:
