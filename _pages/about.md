I am **Damiano Giusti**, passionate **Android developer**, rock **music lover** and **guitar player**.

Welcome to my blog, a place where I share some pills from my every day experience about mobile apps 
development and software engineering. 

I started developing for the Android platform back in 2013, and I published my first **app** in 
the same year. It was a mobile version for an italian well-known **electronic grade book**. Since I was
at school in such period, I was using my grade book on a daily basis for checking assignments, 
schedules and, obviously, grades. At that time there wasn't an official application for receiving
notifications and allowing students to easy consult their school report... Until my app was born!

# What I do

I'm currently working as **Software Engineer** at [MOLO17](https://molo17.com), an italian company 
which moves really fast. I'm an **Android Engineer**, but also I write some iOS stuff at times.

I'm involved in different projects for various customers, following all the development process steps.
Moreover, I like writing about my work and my thoughts on [the company's blog](https://blog.molo17.com).

... _aaand_ I'm also a **guitar** player. I play in two bands, and I love **rock** music!

# What I craft

I love exploring new technologies and applying new architectures to my projects. 

I'm proudly advocating for the adoption of the **Kotlin** language. I built the latest project of
my company using it with profit. Also, I'm experimenting the **Kotlin Multiplatform** feature, 
discovering the great amount of possibilities that such technology makes available to us. 

# What I say

I also held some talks. I proudly participated as a speaker at the first edition of the **Milan 
KotlinCommunityConf**, the first italian conference dedicated to **Kotlin**, in 2018.  

Here's the list of the events for you, with some references where available.

#### [2018] [ENG] Kotlin+RxJava: Android goes SOLID! ‚Äì [Video](https://vimeo.com/279206868)
First talk of mine I held at **Milan KotlinCommunityConf 2018**. Here I explain how 
I used **Kotlin** together with **RxJava** in a project at MOLO17, applying **Clean Architecture**.  

#### [2018] [ITA] Android Clean Architecture ‚Äì [Video](https://youtu.be/XViH7tGpffQ?t=1982)
An informal talk I held at Mikamai-LinkMe offices in Milan (Italy). Talking about **Clean Architecture**
to the rescue where **legacy code** spreads unconfined. I had a good time, ending with networking... 
and pizza! üçï 

#### [2018] [ITA] Discover Kotlin (Workshop)  
A workshop I held at **TEDx** in Castelfranco Veneto (Treviso, Italy). The attendees were students and
professionals, and the aim of the session was introducing Java developers to the **Kotlin** language.
